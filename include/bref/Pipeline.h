/**
 * \defgroup Pipeline Pipeline
 *
 * \brief The pipeline contains all the hooks points available for the
 *        bref API.
 *
 * When a module is initialized by the method
 * \c AModule#registerHooks(Pipeline &) it initializes its hook points
 * in the Pipeline.
 *
 * This page describes how the Pipeline class works and how it interacts
 * with the different hook points.
 *
 * Vocabulary:
 * - \e Hook:
 *
 *   Hooks are RequestHandlers (see below) generators for a given set
 *   of arguments. If -- given the argument(s) it received -- a hook
 *   decides not to handle a request, a null handler is generated.
 *
 *   Examples of hooks are: Pipeline::PostParsingHook,
 *   Pipeline::OnReceiveHook, ...
 *
 *   In term of code, a hook is a Function object that returns another
 *   Function object. It's often constructed with an Environment and an
 *   HttpRequest.
 *
 * - \e RequestHandler:
 *
 *   A request handler (e.g: Pipeline::ConnectionRequestHandler,
 *   Pipeline::OnReceiveRequestHandler) is the function object, returned
 *   by the hook, that will handle a request. It should be called with
 *   the arguments provided by its corresponding hook point
 *   (e.g.: the Pipeline::ConnectionRequestHandler takes an HttpResponse
 *   and an IpAddress).
 *
 *   The majority of the request handlers takes an HttpResponse as
 *   reference, they can fill its header. When a response is finished,
 *   the upstream or bridge elements of the pipeline will directly go
 *   to the downstream part.
 *
 * - \e Priority
 *
 *   Used to represent the precedence of one request handler over
 *   another, when placed on the same hook point.
 *   Depending on the hook point, either all the request handlers will be
 *   called, starting with the highest priority, or only the most important
 *   one will be called.
 *
 *   The priority is a floating number between 0.0 and 1.0.
 *   Modules should try to follow the following convention (but the value
 *   can be adapted):
 *   - Low Priority:    0.0
 *   - Normal Priority: 0.5
 *   - High Priority:   1.0
 *
 * Example for a CGI module:
 *
 * 1. Register a Pipeline::ContentHook with a high priority (1.0)
 *    that returns a valid Pipeline::ContentRequestHandler if it detects
 *    a request asking a PHP file (by checking the .php extension for
 *    example and some configuration variables), otherwise it should
 *    return an empty handler.
 *
 * 2. Create the Pipeline::ContentRequestHandler that creates a
 *    process when it's constructed, and has a function operator()
 *    that takes each chunk of the request body and send them to the
 *    CGI process, and fill a buffer in return.
